BBC BASIC is the programming language originally specified and adopted by the British Broadcasting Corporation for its groundbreaking Computer Literacy Project of the early 1980s.

It was designed to be simple enough to be used by a complete beginner yet powerful enough to cope with the demands of the very largest and most complex programs, and that remains true today.

During the intervening years BBC BASIC has been extended and ported onto at least seven different CPUs and more than thirty different platforms.

BBC BASIC for SDL 2.0 is an advanced cross-platform implementation of BBC BASIC which will run on Windows™, Linux® (x86), Mac OS-X®, Raspberry Pi, Android™, iOS™ and in a browser.  It supports a number of major enhancements over early versions.

These include data structures, an EXIT statement, PRIVATE variables, long strings, event interrupts, an 'address of' operator, byte variables and arrays, a line continuation character, indirect procedure and function calls and improved numeric accuracy.

BBC BASIC incorporates an assembler, making it practical to write programs which use machine-code for time-critical routines.  Programs can also call Operating System API functions, both from BASIC and from assembler code.
