•    BBC BASIC is the programming language originally specified and adopted by the British Broadcasting Corporation for its groundbreaking Computer Literacy Project of the early 1980s.

BBC BASIC for SDL 2.0 is an advanced cross-platform implementation which will run on Windows®, MacOS®, Linux® (x86), Raspberry Pi OS™, Android™, iOS® and in a browser.

The Android, iOS and in-browser editions have a simplified user interface.  To run a program, navigate to the appropriate folder (games, general, graphics, physics, sounds or tools) and tap/click on the program's name.

To exit a program and return to the main menu, tap on the Back [<] button (Android) or press the Escape key.  In iOS there is a soft [<] button; it may not always be displayed but tapping in the top-left corner should still work.

To create a new program, first navigate to the @usr$ folder then long-press or right-click below the list of files and select New file from the context menu.  Alternatively create a new folder under @usr$ and put your program there.

To edit a program, long-press or right-click on the program's name and select Edit from the context menu.  To exit the editor tap on the [<] button or press the Escape key. You cannot edit the supplied example programs.

In Android and iOS the contents of the @usr$ folder may be accessed from a desktop computer using a USB connection, or from the Files app in iOS.

It is inevitable that from time to time BBC BASIC will crash (for example abort with an untrapped error), especially if you are testing and debugging your own programs. If this happens it will not damage your device or other apps, but it will be necessary to close BBC BASIC fully and open it again.
